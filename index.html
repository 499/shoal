<p>A squid cache publishing and advertising tool designed to work in fast changing environments. </p>

<h2>
<a name="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h2>

<p>The purpose of shoal is to allow you to build a continually updated list of squid caches. Each squid runs 
shoal-agent which uses AMQP messages to publish the existence and load of the squid to the central shoal-server. 
Shoal-server keeps a list of squids in memory and removes any squid which has not sent it a message recently. 
The IPs of all squid servers are geo-referenced. Clients contact the squid server using a REST interface to 
retrieve an ordered list of the nearest squids. The diagram below should give you some idea how this works:</p>

<h2>
<a name="components" class="anchor" href="#components"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Components</h2>

<p><strong>shoal-server</strong> maintains the list of running squids. It uses RabbitMQ to handle incoming AMQP messages from 
squid servers. It provides a REST interface for programatically retrieving a json formatted ordered list of squids.
It also provides a web interface for viewing the list.</p>

<p><strong>shoal-agent</strong> runs on squid servers and publishes the load and IP of the squid server to the shoal-server using 
a json formatted AMQP message at regular intervals. This agent is designed to be trivially installed in a
few seconds with python's pip tool.</p>

<p><strong>shoal-client</strong> is a reference client that can be used to contact the REST interface of the shoal-server.</p>

<p>All the components can be installed independently. Refer to the individual component READMEs for install 
instructions:</p>

<ul>
